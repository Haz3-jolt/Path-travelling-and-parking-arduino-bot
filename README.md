#### Description:


**Hi,** I am Hari
And this is my CS50x final proeject about a Arduino Robot.

The project I am submitting for my final project is a robot using the Arduino platform. The main goal of the project is to create a Robot which travels along a track while avoiding the boundaries and obstacles along the way, and park within the designated square. 
The main Program is written in C using the Arduino IDE. The Program has custom functions to lower the load on the limited processing power of the uno.

The track is a U-Shape with a border, with a box at the end where the bot is going to park in. The track is made out of a vinyl type material.

Requirements if someone wanted to recreate the Project:-
1) A good understanding of C and the Arduino Library.
2) Soldering skills for extending wires and making the battery pack.
3) Understanding Schematics and being able to configure them
4) Using a laser cutter (Optional)
5) Knowing how to debug analog sources
6) Being able to properly calibrate the sensors

All the items used in the project:-
1) Arduino Uno
2) Sensor shield V2
3) Laser Etched body
4) Motors
5) Rubber wheels
6) Motor Controller
7) Ultrasonic Sensor
8) IR Sensor
9) Batteries (Preferably Rechargeable)
10) A variety of Wires (Male to Male, Male To Female, Female to Female)
11) Soldering Iron
12) bread board for testing


Special Thanks to:-
1) Ajman University for the track
2) CS50 subreddit for good learning sources.
